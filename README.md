- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrianWCanada
- 👀 I’m interested in sustainable engineering.  My "Pulser Pump" is on wikipedia and I have contributed to airlift pump design for aquaponics development too.  I have also designed several solar cooking reflectors and solar trackers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about mechanical heliostats because one of my solar trackers should be easily able to run a small heliostat to illuminate a greenhouse.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an electric or magnetic valve  for my air pressure timed solar tracker.  Current valve is a piece of rubber tube and a wooden clamp.  It works but it is too primitive for modern folk.

- 😄 Pronouns: Mr...
- ⚡ Fun fact:This is mostly a hardware project ...
